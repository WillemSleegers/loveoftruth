# Measuring motivated resoning: 
(need something that covers the main aspects of motivated reasoning, seeking, interpretation and evaluation of evidence?)

Measured ability to admit that the politician they support made contradictory statements.

"The stereotype that the Irish tend to like their drink was
transformed into a Wasonrule,“AllIrisharealcoholics.” Some participants tested a rule that, if true, implied
something negative about themselves", in which case they would be motivated to falsify it.


# What else should it correlate with? 
- Bullshit Receptivity Scale (BRS). Pennycook, Cheyne, Barr, Koehler, and Fugelsang (2015).
- Belief in Science Scale (BSS). (Farias, Newheiser, Kahane, & de Toledo, 2013).  
- Rosenbery Self-esteem scale??? Martín-Albo, J., Núñez, J. L., Navarro, J. G., & Grijalvo, F. (2007). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale: translation and validation in university students. The Spanish journal of psychology, 10(02), 458-467.
- Attitudes  and  Beliefs  Scale  2 (DiGiuseppe  et  al.,  1988): measures irrational beliefs. The ABS2 is a 72-item scale consisting of a 4x3x2 matrix. The   first   factor   consists   of   belief   processes   and   has   four   levels   representing   demandingness   (DEM),   self-worth   or   self-downing   (SD),   low   frustration  tolerance  (LFT)  and  awfulizing  (AWF).  The  second  factor  includes  content/context  information  and  has  three  levels  representing  beliefs  about  affiliation,  achievement  and  comfort.  The  third  factor  determines  if  the  item  is  worded   rationally   or   irrationally.
