                <p>We are interested in how people think about truth. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between what you 
believe to be true and whether it is actually true. Below are a series of statements that you can agree or disagree with. 
Please read each statement and take a moment to think about what it might mean and whether you agree or disagree with the 
statement.</p>
<h3 id="selected-items">Selected items:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To me, it is most important to know what is true and what is not. </li>
<li>Ensuring my beliefs are accurate is very important to me.</li>
<li>It is O.K. that some people believe things that are not supported by evidence. R</li>
<li>For me, the story/narrative is more important than the facts. R (<em>This one might be a bit difficult to understand I think. Can we simplify this?</em>)</li>
<li>I believe some things because they are fun, it does not really matter whether they are true or not. R</li>
<li>I want to know the truth, even when I don’t like it. # Is the meaning of 'it' clear enough?</li>
<li>It is O.K. to believe something if it makes me feel better about the world, even if it’s not true. R</li>
<li>I prefer to believe in things that comfort me.</li>
<li>It is O.K. to believe something if it leads you to do something good for yourself or others, even if it’s not true. </li>
<li>Sometimes I believe something just for the fun of it.</li>
<li>I stand up for what I believe to be true even if it goes against what those around me think.</li>
<li>I know it’s not real but I like to do somethings for luck, such as knocking, wood or hanging a horseshoe above my door or carrying a rabbit’s foot. R (<em>This one might be tricky, because what if they do believe?</em>)</li>
<li>It is O.K. to form beliefs about facts based on how it makes you feel. </li>
<li>Everyone is entitled to their own truth.</li>
<li>Everyone’s beliefs are equally true.</li>
<li>If two people are arguing about something, at least one of them must be wrong.</li>
<li>I want to have acurate beliefs, even for trivial things. R</li>
<li>I would prefer to have an overly optimistic view of myself than a realistic one. </li>
<li>I would prefer to have an overly optimistic view of the world than a realistic one. </li>
<li>I want to feel good about myself, rather than be accurate. </li>
<li>I would want to know what someone really thinks about me, even if it’s unpleasant to hear. R</li>
<li>I want to know the truth about my abilities even if it hurts to find that out. R</li>
<li>I prefer to believe in something comforting, rather than the truth. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>What about an item of you correcting other people's incorrect beliefs, having discussions, etc?</em>
<em>We should also throw a few filler items in there that should not relate to our topic of interest.</em></p>
<p>Open question:
The exact meaning of 'truth' can be difficult to define and is likely to differ between people. What does truth mean to you?</p>
<h3 id="unselected-items">Unselected items:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I like to believe things because they make me feel a less stressed, even if its not entirely true.</li>
<li>I would choose believing something fun that helps me stay calm over something that is true. </li>
<li>It’s ok to distort your view of the world if it makes you feel better.</li>
<li>I always want to know the truth even if it makes me afraid. R</li>
<li>I know things like karma aren't real but it makes me feel better about the world.</li>
<li>If I had to choose between believing the exact truth or a fun belief, sometimes I would choose fun. </li>
<li>Sometime I believe something for fun, it doesn’t matter whether it’s true or not.</li>
<li>Sometimes, I’d prefer to believe something for fun, rather than be accurate all the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the above items, please indicate the extent to which you think knowing the truth/being accurate in your beliefs is good/bad for you in the long run.</p>
